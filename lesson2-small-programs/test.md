# Learning-Github (#)
    Sample repo for learning testing testing! 
    This is part of gray area maybe for description?
## sub heading (like H2) (##)
Some more text blah blah. spacing out is two carriage returns:

there needs to be space above

- hyphen and space equals bullet
- second one also can be directly underneath, no two carriage returns
    - indentation
        1. inner number
            - square bullet using hyphen, no 2 carriage returns
            - no carriage returns again
        
            a. alphabet (interesting needs 2 carriage returns for this, with **any** type of bullet point 2 carriage returns above)
            
            
[square brackets for description](url goes here)

This paragraph has some `variable` (backtick)

Create fenced code blocks by placing ``` before and after the code block:


(```) + language and end with 3 backticks
```javascript

let i = 'i am learning';

let learn = 'markdown';

console.log(i + ' ' + learn); 
```

Cool trick to see the difference in a code is using

3 backticks (```)   + diff

Type (-) before line idicates to remove
Type (+) before line indicates to add

```diff
let try = 'always';
- let trials = 'difficult';
+ trials = 'opportunity to grow';
```

`try` and `try again`
