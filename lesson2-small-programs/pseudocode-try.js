GET	              | retrieve input from user
PRINT	            | display output to user
READ	            | retrieve a value from a variable

Write pseudocode that attempts to solve:
1. function that returns the sum of two nums

2. function that takes an array of strings, returns a string
  that is all those strings concatenated together 

3. method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array
  with every other element from the original array, 
  starting with the first element. For instance:
  
  everyOther([1,4,7,2,5]); // => [1,7,5]

4. a function that determines the index of the 3rd 
  occurrence of a given character in a string. 
  For instance, if the given character is 'x' 
  and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function 
  should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). 
  If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

5. a function that takes two arrays of numbers and 
  returns the result of merging the arrays. 
  The elements of the first array should become 
  the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, 
  while the elements of the second array should become 
  the elements at the odd indexes. For instance:

  merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]); // => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
